//! Gas Station Problem
//! leetcode question 134:

//* Logic:
//* in this problem we have gas stations in circular fashion 
//* gas [] -> denotes different gas station having amount of gas in them. both gas and cost are of same size.
//* cost [] -> denotes how much fuel you need to go from a gas station to the one after it by gas[i]. 
//* like gas[i] for example gas=[1,2,3,4,5] , cost=[3,4,5,1,2]
//* so gas[0] needs 3 gas to go to gas[1] and 3 is cost[0]. 
//* so gas[i]>=cost[i] to start from a station and go to the next one.
//* so delta = gas[i]-cost[i] and delta should always be +ve to start.
//* at start the tank of car is empty.
//* solution is when u travel a whole round trip ie when starting point and ending point is same.
//* if total cost>total gas, no matter where u start u cannot complete the trip
//* so trip can only be possible is total gas>totalcost meaning total delta should be >=0 .
//* problem is to find starting point.
//* to start u should note delta>=0 at a point.

//? FOR FINDING THE STARTING POINT:
/*
1. delta >= 0 then we can start the car from that point
2. We will keep track of total delta and current delta
3. If current delta < 0 then we will change the starting point to the next station and reset the current delta to 0
4. If total delta < 0 then we can't complete the circle so we will return -1
5. But if total delta >= 0 then we will return the starting point
